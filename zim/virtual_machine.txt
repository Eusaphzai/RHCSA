**Summary**
A virtual machine is a computer system that is emulated in sofware, as opposed to a physical computer system. A virtual machine typically runs as a guest on a physical host machine. For example, a physical computer running the [[Fedora]] computer operating system could host a virtual machine running the [[CentOS]] computer operating system. The virtual machine would run on [[virtualization software]] such as [[KVM]].
