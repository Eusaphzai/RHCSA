[[legacy boot process - stage 5 - Init]]

**Summary**
systemd is a newer system that replaced the older System V Init system. systemd replaces the Init system concept of run levels with [[systemd targets]]. Each systemd target defines a different mode of operation. 

sytemd targets are represented by target units which each end with a .target file extension. There are eight systemd targets, and they are all described [[systemd targets|here]].

**Advantages of systemd over init:**
* better dependency handling
* faster system startups due to more parallel (vice linear) operations
* can snapshot system state, and restore to a known good configuration

**Analogies to the old init system**
In the traditional init system, the system run levels were stored in /etc/inittab. Run level 5 had full user access with a graphical display environment and networking enabled.  The graphical.target level in systemd is the equivalent of the old init run level 5.

The current systemd level can be viewed using the [[systemctl]] get-default command:
