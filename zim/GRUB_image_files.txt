[[boot.img]]

GRUB image files
* [[boot.img]]
	* the first part of [[GRUB]] to start
	* is contained in the Master Boot Record ([[MBR]])
	* since boot sector is 512 bytes, boot.img is 512 bytes as well => designed to fit in the boot sector
	* boot.img has a simple function: read the first sector of the core image and jump to it (the first sector of the core image contains diskboot.img).
* [[diskboot.img]]
	* is contained in the first sector of the core image
	* does not have file handling, so the location of core.img is hard coded into it
	* reads remainder of core image into memory and loads the operating system kernel
* [[cdboot.img]]
	* performs the same functions as diskboot image if booting from a CD-ROM.
	* acts as first sector of core image when booting from CD-ROM
* [[pxeboot.img]]
	* acts as stage of core image when booting from network using PXE boot
* [[lnxboot.img]]
	* image that looks very similar to Linux kernel
	* when placed at start of core image, allows booting via [[LILO]]
* [[kernel.img]]
	* contains GRUB's basic run-time facilities. Is rarely used.
* [[core.img]]
	* is the core image of GRUB
	* is built dynamically from the kernel image and kernel modules
	* is designed to be kept small
