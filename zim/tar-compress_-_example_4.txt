====== tar-compress - example 4 ======
Created Thursday 12 July 2018

[[tar-compress - examples]]
examples template

**Summary**
In the first 3 tar-compress examples, we did not use [[bzip2]] compression. In example 4, we will use the -j flag on the [[tar]] command to ensure that the file is compressed using bzip2.

Tasks (NOTE: in examples, terminal commands are __highlighted__):
* Navigate to [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/tar/tar-compress_ex004]]
* Create a new file called myfile using the [[touch]] command.
* Verbosely compress myfile to myfile.tbz using the appropriate [[tar]] command.
