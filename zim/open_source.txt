**Summary**
Open source is a model for building software using an open collaborative process. Open source sofware is typically built using a license that gives anyone the right to study, modify and redistribute the software, and its source code, under the same or similar open source software license. Open source software is typically built and maintained by teams of people who work together in a collaborative process, often using version control software such as [[git]] or [[subversion]]. The open source software development teams are often spread far apart geographically.  This is not a problem because centralized repositories such as [[GitHub]] and Gitlab allow each team member to check out and work on their own copy of the software's source code.  Improvements can then be submitted by team members, and "pulled" into the canonical version of the project's source code.
