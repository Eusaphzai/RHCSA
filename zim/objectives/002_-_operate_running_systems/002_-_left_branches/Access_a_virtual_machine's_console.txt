**KYWRD:** console

**Summary**
On Fedora and CentOS, I access the console using virt-manager. In this article, I'll explain how I use the console on a virtual machine.

**console:**
* console - function: a console is a text-based window that allow you to send receive messages with the Linux kernel.
* console - description: To use the console, I first have to create a virtual machine.  My operating system of choice is Centos since it is very similar to RHEL.
	* I went through the steps to get a virtual machine running here: [[Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems as virtual guests]]
	* In this article, we will interact with the virtual machine's console in the examples below.
* console - options-flags N/A
