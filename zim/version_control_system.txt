**Summary**
A version control system is software that helps software developers to manage updates to software source code, especially when those updates are being made by different people, at different times, often in different locations. Version control systems help to minimize conflicts, and to manage conflicts when they do occur. For example, if two software developers try to make conflicting changes to the same source code file at the same time, the version control system might alert both develpers of the problem.
