[[touch - example 004]]

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.  

For example, let us look at the [[touch]] command.  
* **Not using regular expressions:** We could use the touch command to create five files by explicitly stating the name of the five files (myfile1 - myfile5) (hence not using a regular expressions). That command would look like this:
	* touch myfile1 myfile2 myfile3 myfile4 myfile5
* **Using regular expressions:  **The command above becomes cumbersome if one needs to create a lot of empty files (imagine if one had to create 1,000 empty files with a similar name). This is where regular expressions help. Consider this command:
	* touch myfile{1,2,3,4,5}
	* it creates the exact same 5 files as the previous touch command, but is much shorter.
