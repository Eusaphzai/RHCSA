[[star]]

**Summary**
In general, the [[star]] command is used to compress files and folers into an archive using the -c option. 
* The star -c command compresses the named files and/or directories in a tarfile.  The c in -c stands for create, as in create the tar archive.
* When the command is invoved, the desired name of the tar archive is also given.  This done with the -f flag  or the -file flag
* If the user wants detailed information as to what is going on during the compression, they can invoke the -v flag (v stands for verbose).

So a complete star compression command might look something like this:
* star -cv -f=tarfilename input_file1 input_file2........

In [[star example 3]], we will take a closer look at how the star -cv -f=tarfilename command works.
