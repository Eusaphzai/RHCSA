Created Wednesday 11 July 2018

[[Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2]]

**Summary:**
The name star comes from standard tape archiver.  The star utility is very similar to the [[tar]] utility, but it provides improved functionality. The star utility is better designed to work in an [[Security-Enhanced Linux]] ([[SELinux]]) environment. Star may not be installed on your system by default (it was not installed on my Fedora system).  To install it, I had to issue the following command:
* su -c "dnf install star"

On [[CentOS]] or [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]], the appropriate install command will probably be this:
* su -c "yum install star"

star executable location: [[/usr/bin/star]]

star man page locations:
* /usr/share/man/man5/star.5.gz 
* /usr/share/man/man1/star.1.gz
