[[Bootstrap Loader]]

**Summary**
The function of the Boot Loader is the load the computer's operating system into memory during the boot process. The Boot Loader is found in the [[MBR]] (Master Boot Record), or in the [[GUID Partition Table]]. The Boot Loader is not enabled until after the POST (Power On Self Test) is completed, and the POST status is "PASS". In Linux, the most popular Boot Loader is [[GRUB]]. The Boot Loader is sometimes referred to as the [[Bootstrap Loader]].  They are one and the same.

The Boot Loader is divided into two categories:
* The [[First-Stage Boot Loader]]
* The [[Second-Stage Boot Loader]] - this is typically Grub on most Linux systems.


**Description**
The following steps occur after you hit the power button to turn on your computer:
* [[POST]] (Power On Self Test)
* After the POST is completed, the [[Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:002 - operate running systems:002 - right branches:Boot, reboot, and shut down a system normally:boot:BIOS-MBR - legacy boot process:legacy boot process - stage 1 - BIOS:BIOS]] locates bootable boot media.
* When it finds bootable media, it reads that media's [[master boot record]] ([[MBR]]) or [[GUID Partition Table]] to obtain instructions.
	* during this read process, BIOS obtains two important pieces of information: 
		1. the Boot Loader
		2. the partition table
* Once the Boot Loader is found, the Boot Loader then loads the computer's operating system into memory.
