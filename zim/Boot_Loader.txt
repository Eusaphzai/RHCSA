[[Bootstrap Loader]]

**Summary**
The function of the Boot Loader is the load the computer's operating system into memory during the boot process. The Boot Loader is found in the [[MBR]] (Master Boot Record), or in the [[GUID Partition Table]]. The Boot Loader is not enabled until after the POST (Power On Self Test) is completed, and the POST status is "PASS". In Linux, the most popular Boot Loader is [[GRUB]]. The Boot Loader is sometimes referred to as the [[Bootstrap Loader]].  They are one and the same.

**Description**
The following steps occur after you hit the power button to turn on your computer:
* [[POST]] (Power On Self Test)
* After the POST is completed, the [[BIOS]] locates bootable boot media.
* When it finds bootable media, it reads that media's [[master boot record]] ([[MBR]]) or [[GUID Partition Table]] to obtain instructions.
	* during this read process, BIOS obtains two important pieces of information: 
		1. the Boot Loader
		2. the partition table
* Once the Boot Loader is found, the Boot Loader then loads the computer's operating system into memory.
