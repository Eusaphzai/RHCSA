The gpg command allows to encrypt, decypt, and digitally sign files, folders, and messages. The gpg command runs GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG), a free software implementation of the [[+OpenPGP]] standard.

One of the most commonly used gpg flags is -c.  This option encrypts with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase.  For example, the command below would encrypt the file name myfile

gpg -c myfile
