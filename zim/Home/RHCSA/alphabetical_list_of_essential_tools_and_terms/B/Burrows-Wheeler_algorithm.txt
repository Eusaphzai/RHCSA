Burrows-Wheeler algorithm
* very good compression performance
* [[Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:B:block sorting text compression algorithm]]
* [[Huffman coding]]
* compresses large files in blocks

Common flags/options:
* -c --stdout
	* compress or decompress to standard output (the monitor)
* -d --decompress
	* forces decompression using bzip2
* -t --test
	* check integrity of specified file(s).  trial decompression only with results discarded.
* -f --force
	* force overwrite of output files
* -k --keep
	* don't delete input files during compression/decompression/testing.
* -s --small
	* reduce memory usage for compresssion, decompression, and testing
* -q --quiet
	* suppresses warning messages that are not essential
* -v --verbose
	* shows compression ratio for each file processed, and provides an overall much more verbose output
* -L --license -V --version
	* displays version, license, and terms & conditions information
* -1 --fast to -9 --best
	* sets focus of compression: speed or better compression.  has no effect on decompression.
* — (2 dashes)
	* allows you to deal with files whose name starts with a dash (eg bzip2 — -myfile)
* --repetitive-fast --repetitive-best
	* used to set focus of sorting algorithm (speed versus quality). no longer relevant flags.
