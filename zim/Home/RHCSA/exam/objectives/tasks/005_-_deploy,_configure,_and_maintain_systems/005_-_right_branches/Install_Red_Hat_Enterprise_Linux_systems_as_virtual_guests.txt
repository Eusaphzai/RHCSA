====== Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems as virtual guests ======
Created Monday 16 July 2018

[[005 - right branches]]

**Summary**
On Monday July 30th/Tuesday July 31st 2018, I installed Centos 7 Minimal ISO as a virtual guest on my Fedora 28 system for the first time.  In this article, I will walk you through the process.

**My Thought Process**
I decided to go with the Minimal ISO because it would give me the biggest opportunity to learn: I would have to install and configure a lot of apps and services on my own. I went to https://www.centos.org/download, and I chose to download the Minimal ISO.

I clicked on Minimal ISO, and chose the top mirror:

The download was 906 MB, so you'll want to make sure that you have enough room for it on your host computer. I had plenty of space: about 258 GB free in my home directory.  I found this out using the [[alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:D:df]] -BG command.  See [[alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:D:df:df - examples:df - example 1]] for more info on this. 

For a virtualization platform, I decided to use the preferred virtualization manager in the Red Hat: [[KVM]]. I already had the main package, qemu-kvm installed, but I had to install virt-manager. For this demo, I decided to uninstall qemu-kvm first so that you could see the entire installation process. Now, I am going to install KVM, and all of its dependencies, by using the dnf command.  On a Red Hat or Centos system, you will probably use the yum command instead. Here is the command I will use (it has to be run as root, so I use su -c):
* su -c "dnf install qemu-kvm qemu-img virt-manager libvirt libvirt-python libvirt-client virt-install virt-viewer" 
* the RHEL/CentOS equivalent would be: su -c "yum install qemu-kvm qemu-img virt-manager libvirt libvirt-python libvirt-client virt-install virt-viewer" 
* The terminal output was very long, so I chose not to paste it here.

It is now time to create the Centos 7 virtual machine:
* To let the KVM kernel modules take effect, I will first reboot my system.
* When my system is back up, I click on the Virtual Machine Manager icon in my Fedora 28 apps window, and it asks me for my root password.  
* After entering the root password, I am greeted with the window below:

* I click on the "create a new virtual machine" icon in the upper left corner.
* I select "Local install media (ISO image or CDROM)" and hit "Forward"
* "Use ISO image" is pre-selected, so I hit "Browse" and navigate to the folder where I just downloaded the Minimal ISO.
* I hit "Browse Local" and navigate to the download folder (this folder will differ based on where YOU downloaded the Minimal ISO file).
* Once in the correct folder, I select CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1804.iso and hit "Open" (the file name may differ slightly depending on when you follow this example).
* The "Automatically detect..." checkbox is already checked.  I leave it as is, and hit "Forward".
* These next numbers will be different based on how poweful your system is.  
	* I have almost 16 GB of RAM in my system, so I decided to allocate 5 GB of RAM to my virtual machine.
	* I have 8 CPU cores available, so I decided to allocate 3 cores to my virtual machine.
	* At the screen below, I hit "Forward":

	* At step 4 of 5, I left the "Enable storage.." box checked, and left it at the default value of 10.0 GiB.
	* I hit "Forward".
	* In the next step, 5 of 5, I left the default chosen name as centos7.0, and hit "Finish".
	* My Centos 7 virtual machine was built and started after I hit "Finish".
	* A pop up widow asked me if I wanted to allow the VM Manager to inhibit shortcuts. I chose "Allow".
	* At this point, I was greeted by the Centos 7 installation window below:

	* I won't go through every step of the install.  You can practice with the parameters that you feel best, and if you mess up, you can always do it all over again. Virtual Machines can be created, destroyed, and re-created easily.
	* My only major decision during the install was not choosing to enable networking during the graphical install.  I want to learn how to do it from the command line later.
	* I did choose automatic partitioning, and I did create a root password and a non-root user account for myself during the installation.
	* I chose to not encrypt the data on the VM.
	* I hit "Begin Installation".
	* WARNING: depending on how modern your pc is, the "performing post-installation setup tasks" could take a very long time. It took several minutes on my system.
	* After the installation was complete, I hit "Reboot".
	* I am proud to present my [[alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:C:CentOS]] 7 virtual machine below:
