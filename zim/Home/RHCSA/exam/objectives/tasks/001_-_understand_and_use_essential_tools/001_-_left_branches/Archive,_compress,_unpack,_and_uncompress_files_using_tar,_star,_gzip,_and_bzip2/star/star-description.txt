star is a unique standard tape archiver with the following characteristics:
* fast
* improved functionality when compared to Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:001 - left branches:Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2:tar
* originally designed to archive to  and extract files from tarfiles on magnetic tapes
* Modern star can store/extract archives to/from any kind of storage medium.
* uses [[fifo]] to optimize data flow to/from tape
* star has a sophisticated diff command that is implemented with the -diff flag (note that Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:001 - left branches:Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2:tar also has diff implemented with the --diff or --compare flag)

Star has many options, so I decided to break off its options to a separate file:
* [[star-options]]
