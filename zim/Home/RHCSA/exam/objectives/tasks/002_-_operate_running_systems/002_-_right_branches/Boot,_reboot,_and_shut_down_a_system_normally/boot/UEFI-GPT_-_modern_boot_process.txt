**KYWRD:** UEFI

**Summary**
The UEFI-GPT - modern boot process is more complicated than the older BIOS-MBR - legacy boot process. In this article, I will walk you through how the UEFI boot process works.

**Steps**
1. GRUB loads itself into memory in 3 stages:
	a. Stage 1: 
		* UEFI reads the partition table of the boot device.
		* UEFI mounts the [[+EFI System Partition]] (ESP).
	b. Stage 2:
		* The grub.efi bootloader is loaded into memory from [[/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/]]
	c. Stage 3:
		* GRUB determines which operating system to start
		* GRUB loads the operating system into memory
		* GRUB transers control of the computer to that operating system
