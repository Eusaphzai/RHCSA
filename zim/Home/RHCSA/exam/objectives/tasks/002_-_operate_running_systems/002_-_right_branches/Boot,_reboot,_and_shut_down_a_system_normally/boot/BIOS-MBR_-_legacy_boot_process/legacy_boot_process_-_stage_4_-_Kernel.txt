[[BIOS-MBR - legacy boot process]]

**Summary**
After GRUB Stages [[GRUB Stage 1|1]], [[GRUB Stage 1.5|1.5]], and [[GRUB Stage 2|2]] are complete, the kernel and [[initrd]] images are loaded into memory.  At this point, the filesystem is initialized, so the kernel file can be loaded from its directory (kernel files are typically kept in the [[/boot]] directory on most Linux computer systems). These can easily by using all templates:options template:alphabetical list of essential tools:C:cd to change directory to the [[/boot]] directory, and running Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:ls. The kernel file names start with vm, which stands for Virtual Memory. vmlinuz* are the Linux kernel executable files.  Note that they are highlighted in green.  Only one of the four kernel files highlighted in green below (typically the newest one) would be loaded during each boot.
