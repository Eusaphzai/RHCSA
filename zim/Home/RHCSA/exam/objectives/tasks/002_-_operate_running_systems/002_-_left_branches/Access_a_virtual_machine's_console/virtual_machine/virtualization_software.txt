**Summary**
Virtualization software allows a virtual computer, or multiple virtual computers, to be created within the confines of physical host computer hardware. For example, a mainframe computer (the physical host machine in this case) with 2 TB of RAM and 400 TB of disk storage could host dozens of virtual computers (known as virtual machines).  Each of these virtual machines would exist only in the virtualization software, and the software would allow the guest machines to share the resources of the physical host machine.
