**Summary**
gzip compresses the named file using the [[Lempel-Ziv coding]] ([[LZ77]]), la ossless compression algorithm  using variable-rate coding created in 1977 by [[Abraham Lempel]] and [[Jacob Ziv]]. gzip compression is also employed when the -z flag option is applied to the [[Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:001 - left branches:Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2:tar]] command. See [[tar-compress - example 1]] for more details.
