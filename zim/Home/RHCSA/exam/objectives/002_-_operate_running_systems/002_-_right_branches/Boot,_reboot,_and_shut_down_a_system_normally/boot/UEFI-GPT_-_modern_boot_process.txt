====== UEFI-GPT - modern boot process ======
Created Tuesday 17 July 2018

[[boot]]

**Summary**
The UEFI-GPT - modern boot process is more complicated than the older [[Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:002 - operate running systems:002 - right branches:Boot, reboot, and shut down a system normally:boot:BIOS-MBR - legacy boot process|BIOS-MBR - legacy boot process]]. In this article, I will walk you through how the UEFI boot process works.

**Steps**
1. GRUC loads itself into memory in 3 stages:
	a. Stage 1: 
		* UEFI reads the partition table of the boot device.
		* UEFI mounts the EFI System Partition (ESP).
	b. Stage 2:
		* The grub.efi bootloader is loaded into memory from [[/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/]]
	c. Stage 3:
		* GRUB determines which operating system to start
		* GRUB loads the operating system into memory
		* GRUB transers control of the computer to that operating system
