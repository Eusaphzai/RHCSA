**Summary**
BIOS stands for Basic Input-Output System. It consists of a special chip on a computer's mothboard that holds instructions that guide the loading of basic computer hardware. 

**POST - Power On Self Test**
One of the functions of BIOS is to perform a test each time that the personal computer started. This test verifies that the computer meets the minimum requirements to boot properly. The test is known as the [[POST]], or [[Power On Self Test]]. If the POST fails, the computer will beep to alert the computer's operator of the failure.

**BIOS - functions**
The BIOS is tasked with performing four main functions:
* POST -  A test of the computer's hardware to ensure that the computer system is ready to boot. If the POST passes, the computer operating system is allowed to load.
* [[Bootstrap Loader]] - The Boostrap Loader's job is to locate the computer's operating system on disk.  If the BIOS locates a bootable computer operating system, the Bootstrap Loader will pass control of the computer's startup process to that operating system.
* BIOS - The BIOS consists of low-level drivers and software that allow the computer's operating system to communicate with the computer's hardware. BIOS is the first program to run each time the computer is turned on.
* CMOS Setup - [[CMOS]] stands for [[Complemetary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor]]. The primary function of CMOS is to store the BIOS configuration settings.
