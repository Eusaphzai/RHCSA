[[Bootstrap Loader]]
B

**Summary**
The function of the Boot Loader is the load the computer's operating system into memory during the boot process. The Boot Loader is found in the K-O:M:MBR (Master Boot Record), or in the F-J:G:GUID Partition Table. The Boot Loader is not enabled until after the POST (Power On Self Test) is completed, and the POST status is "PASS". In Linux, the most popular Boot Loader is F-J:G:GRUB. The Boot Loader is sometimes referred to as the [[Bootstrap Loader]].  They are one and the same.

The Boot Loader is divided into two categories:
* The F-J:F:First-Stage Boot Loader
* The P-T:S:Second-Stage Boot Loader - this is typically Grub on most Linux systems.


**Description**
The following steps occur after you hit the power button to turn on your computer:
* P-T:P:POST (Power On Self Test)
* After the POST is completed, the Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:002 - operate running systems:002 - right branches:Boot, reboot, and shut down a system normally:boot:BIOS-MBR - legacy boot process:legacy boot process - stage 1 - BIOS:BIOS locates bootable boot media.
* When it finds bootable media, it reads that media's K-O:M:master boot record (K-O:M:MBR) or F-J:G:GUID Partition Table to obtain instructions.
	* during this read process, BIOS obtains two important pieces of information: 
		1. the Boot Loader
		2. the partition table
* Once the Boot Loader is found, the Boot Loader then loads the computer's operating system into memory.
