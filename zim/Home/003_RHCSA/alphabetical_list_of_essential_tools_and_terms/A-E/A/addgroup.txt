**KYWRD:** addgroup
**RHCSA Objective: **006c Create, delete, and modify local groups and group memberships

**Summary**
At the time of this writing (Wednesday 08/15/18 06:58:44 PM), my system (Fedora 28) did not have the addgroup command installed, and I did not find it in a DNF repository search. I verified here that addgroup is not included with Fedora: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/15/html/Deployment_Guide/s1-users-tools.html
