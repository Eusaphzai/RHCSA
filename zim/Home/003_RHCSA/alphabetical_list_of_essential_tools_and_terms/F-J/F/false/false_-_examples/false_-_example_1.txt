**KYWRD:** false

**Summary**
false - example 1 shows that the exit code for the false command is in fact 1 (failure), and that the exit code for the true command is in fact 0 (success). To show the exit code of the false command, we will use this echo command: __echo $?__ 
$? is a special variable that stores the exit code of the most recently run command.

**KEYWORD - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
* Start your CentOS VM using the Virtual Machine Manager.
* Login as a non-root user.
* From the command line, issue the following command: __false;echo $?__
* Note that the false command exits with an exit code of 1, which means "FAILURE".
* From the command line, issue the following command: __true;echo $?__
* Note that the true command exits with an exit code of 0, which means "SUCCESS".
