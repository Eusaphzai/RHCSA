**Summary**
The groupdel command is used to delete groups.

* groupdel - function: delete groups.
* groupdel - description: 
	* groupdel modifies system account files, allowing the system administrator to delete all entries that refer to a given group. 
	* A group that is the primary group of any user on the Linux system cannot be deleted until all members of that group are removed. 
	* When deleting a group, the administrator must manually check all filesystems to make sure to no files remain owned by the group. groupdel will not automatically check this for the administrator.
