**KYWRD:** GRUB
**RHCSA Objective: **005k Modify the system bootloader

**GRUB image files:**
* [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:B:boot.img|boot.img]]:
	* the first part of [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:F-J:G:GRUB|GRUB]] to start.
	* is contained in the [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:K-O:M:MBR|Master Boot Record]].
	* since boot sector is 512 bytes, boot.img is 512 bytes as well => designed to fit in the boot sector.
	* boot.img has a simple function: to read the first sector of the core image and jump to it (the first sector of the core image contains [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:D:diskboot.img|diskboot.img]]).
* [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:D:diskboot.img|diskboot.img]]:
	* is contained in the first sector of the core image.
	* does not have file handling, so the location of core.img is hard coded into it.
	* reads remainder of core image into memory and loads the operating system kernel.
* [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:C:cdboot.img|cdboot.img]]:
	* performs the same functions as diskboot image if booting from a CD-ROM.
	* acts as first sector of core image when booting from CD-ROM.
* [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:P:pxeboot.img|pxeboot.img]]:
	* acts as stage of core image when booting from network using PXE boot.
* [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:K-O:L:lnxboot.img|lnxboot.img]]:
	* image that looks very similar to Linux kernel.
	* when placed at start of core image, allows booting via [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:K-O:L:LILO|LILO]].
* [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:K-O:K:kernel.img|kernel.img]]:
	* contains GRUB's basic run-time facilities. Is rarely used.
* [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:C:core.img|core.img]]:
	* is the core image of GRUB.
	* is built dynamically from the kernel image and kernel modules.
	* is designed to be kept small.
