**KYWRD:** ssh - example 1
**RHCSA Objective: **001d Access remote systems using ssh

**Summary**
Login to a remote shell using [[ssh]]. Create an empty file, populater the file with the names of tech companies, and then exit the remote shell.

**Scenario**
Brian is a RHEL sysadmin-in-training. He wants to practice using the [[ssh]] command. He creates a free remote shell acount at https://sdfeu.org/w , and uses his local RHEL system to login to the remote shell. 
He wants to create a new file called **companies_unsorted.txt**. We will use this same file in [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:S:ssh:ssh - examples:ssh - example 2|ssh - example 2]], so please don't delete it after this lesson is complete.

What command will Brian use to access the remote shell?

**KEYWORD - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
1. Startup your CentOS/RHEL system, and login as a normal user.
2. **(optional, if you don't feel comfortable creating an account sdfeu.org, you can just follow along with this tutorial and learn)** 
	a. Create a free Unix shell account at sdf: https://sdfeu.org/w
3. Login to the remove sdfeu server via [[ssh]] :
	a. __ssh your_username@sdfeu.org__
4. See **Figure 1** below. Your screen should look similar. 
5. It will prompt you to hit Enter and Backspace before you finally get to a command prompt. Once you get the command prompt, enter the **clear** command to give us a nice clean work area:
	a. __clear__
6. Your screen should now look like **Figure 2**.
7. Create a new file named **companies_unsorted.txt** (sdfeu does not have the [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:T:touch|touch]] command available, it uses the [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:P:pico|pico]] text editor to create text files):
	a. __pico companies_unsorted.txt__
	b. Enter the names of the 10 companies below, one company per line:

	d. Hit CTRL+O to write out the file.
	e. It should say "wrote 10 lines" in the bottom of your window.
	f. Exit by entering CTRL+X.
8. __clear__
9. View the new file using the [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:C:cat|cat]] command:
	a. __cat companies_unsorted.txt__
10. Your screen should look like **Figure 4** below.
11. If you decided to create an [[https://sdfeu.org/w|sdfeu.org account]], and do this guide, please don't delete **companies_unsorted.txt**. We will use it again in future exercises.
