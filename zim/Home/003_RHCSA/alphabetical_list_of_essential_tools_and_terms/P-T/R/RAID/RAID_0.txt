**KYWRD:** RAID 0
**RHCSA Objective: **003a List, create, delete partitions on MBR and GPT disks

**Summary:**
RAID 0:
* Also known as **stripe set** or **striped volume**.
* Splits the data evenly across 2 or more disks.
* No parity information.
* No redundancy.
* No fault tolerance.
* Since no fault tolerance or redundancy, the failure of one drive will cause the entire array to fail, resulting in a total loss of data.
* Improved speed performance is the intended goal of RAID 0.
