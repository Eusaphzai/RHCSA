====== legacy boot process - stage 5 - Init ======
Created Wednesday 18 July 2018

[[BIOS-MBR - legacy boot process]]

**Summary**
The Init Proccess has been supplanted on most systems by [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:S:systemd|systemd]]. However, Init is still used on some Linux distributions. For example, the Slackware Linux distribution still uses Init, and has no plans of shifting to [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:S:systemd|systemd]], as on mid-2018. 

The Init Process simply causes the computer system to boot into the run level specified in /etc/inittab.  However, inittab is no longer used on most Linux systems. It has been superceded by [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:S:systemd|systemd]].
