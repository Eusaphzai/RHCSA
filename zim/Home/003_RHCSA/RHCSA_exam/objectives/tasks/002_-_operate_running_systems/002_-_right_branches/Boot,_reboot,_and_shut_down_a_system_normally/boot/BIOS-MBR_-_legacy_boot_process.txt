Created Tuesday 17 July 2018

[[boot]]

**Summary**
The start-up process for all IBM-compatible personal computers can take one of two broad paths, the BIOS-MBR - legacy boot process OR the [[UEFI-GPT - modern boot process]]. This article describes the BIOS-MBR - legacy boot process.

**High-Level Overview**
The BIOS-MBR - legacy boot process is composed of the following steps:
* The personal computer is turned on by hitting the power on switch.
* The BIOS initializes the hardware.

In Linux, the legacy boot process generally has 6 stages:
* [[+legacy boot process - stage 1 - BIOS]]
* [[+legacy boot process - stage 2 - MBR]]
* [[+legacy boot process - stage 3 - GRUB]]
* [[+legacy boot process - stage 4 - Kernel]]
* [[+legacy boot process - stage 5 - Init]]
* [[+legacy boot process - stage 6 - Runlevel]]
