**KYWRD:** console

**Summary**
In console - example 1, we will see how we can view the network service status on a newly created virtual machine.

**console - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
* Step 1: we will boot into our virtual machine, and login.
* Step 2: we will use systemctl to view the status of network services: __systemctl status network__
* Step 3: step 2 shows us that we have an active network service running. Now let's see if can view our network adapters. To do so, we will use this command: __lspci | egreg -i --color 'network|ethernet'__
* Step 4: I installed a minimal iso install of CentOS, so many utilities are not installed. lspci is part of the pciutils package. Since lspci is not installed, I'll try to install it with this command: su -c "yum install pciutils"
* Step 5: step 4 basically told me that the network adapter cannot connect to the Internet, so though my network service is active, either I don't have a network connection device setup, or the one setup cannot connect to the Internet. How will I test what's going on? Using the [[alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:P:ping]] command.
* Step 6: [[alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:P:ping]] tests the capability of a source computer to reach a destination computer through a pinnetwork. I will have the virtual machine ping itself: __ping localhost__
* Step 7: ping works. Some kind of network adapter is active, but it cannot connect to the Internet. Next I'll try to find out details about the network adapter using this command: __ip link show__
* Step 8: now we are getting somewhere. __ip link show__ showed that I have the network interfaces available: lo and eth0. In [[console - example 2|example 2]], I will try to discover how I can activate eth0 so that it can connect to the Internet by connecting to the network adapter on the host Fedora machine.
