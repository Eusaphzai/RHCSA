====== Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems as virtual guests ======
Created Monday 16 July 2018

[[005 - right branches]]

**Summary**
On Monday July 30th, 2018, I installed Centos 7 Minimal ISO as a virtual guest on my Fedora 28 system, and took notes during the install, for the first time.  In this article, I will walk you through the entire process.

**My Thought Process**
I decided to go with the Minimal ISO because it would give me the biggest opportunity to learn: I would have to install and configure a lot of apps and services on my own. I went to https://www.centos.org/download, and I chose to download the Minimal ISO.

I clicked on Minimal ISO, and chose the top mirror:

The download was 906 MB, so you want to make sure that you have enough room for it on the computer that you are going to virtual machine host on. I had plenty of space: about 258 GB free in my home directory.  If found this out using the [[df]] -BG command.
