====== Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems as virtual guests ======
Created Monday 16 July 2018

[[TODO LIST]]

**Summary**
On Monday July 30th, 2018, I installed Centos 7 Minimal ISO as a virtual guest on my Fedora 28 system, and took notes during the install, for the first time.  In this article, I will walk you through the entire process.

**My Thought Process**
I decided to go with the Minimal ISO because it would give me the biggest opportunity to learn: I would have to install and configure a lot of apps and services on my own. I went to https://www.centos.org/download, and I chose to download the Minimal ISO.

I clicked on Minimal ISO, and chose the top mirror: 
http://mirrors.centos.webair.com/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1804.iso

The download was 906 MB, so you want to make sure that you have enough room for it on the computer that you are going to virtual machine host on. I had plenty of space: about 258 GB free in my home directory.  I found this out using the [[df]] -BG command.  See [[df - example 1]] for more info on this. 

For a virtualization platform, I decided to use the preferred virtualization manager in the Red Hat: KVM. I already had the main package, qemu-kvm installed, but I had to install virt-manager. For this demo, I decided to uninstall qemu-kvm first so that you could see the entire installation process. So now, I am going to install qemu-kvm and virt-manager plus all of their dependencies by using the dnf command.  On a Red Hat or Centos system, you will probably use the yum command instead. Here is the command I will use (it has to be run as root, so I use su -c:
* su -c "dnf install qemu-kvm virt-manager" 
* the RHEL/CentOS equivalent would be: su -c "yum install qemu-kvm virt-manager"
* The terminal output was way too long for me to paste the whole thing here, so I will just paste the bottom of the terminal wndow:

It is now time to create the Centos 7 virtual machine:
* I click on the Virtual Machine Manager icon in my Fedora 28 apps window, and it asks me for my root password.  
* After entering the root password, I am greeted with the window below:
* {{./pasted_image003.png}}
* I click on the "create a new virtual machine" icon in the upper left corner.
* I select "Local install media (ISO image or CDROM)" and hit "Forward"
* "Use ISO image" is pre-selected, so I hit "Browse" and navigate to the folder where I just downloaded the Minimal ISO.
* I hit "Browse Local" and navigate to the download folder (this folder will differ based on where YOU downloaded the Minimal ISO file).
* Once in the correct folder, I select CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1804.iso and hit "Open" (the file name may differ slightly depending on when you follow this example).
* The "Automatically detect..." checkbox is automatically checked.  I leave it as is, and hit "Forward".
* These next numbers will be different based on how poweful your system is.  
	* I have almost 16 GB of RAM in my system, so I decided to allocate 5 GB of RAM to my virtual machine.
	* I have 8 CPU cores available, so I decided to allocate 3 cores to my virtual machine.
	* At the screen below, I hit "Forward":
	* {{./pasted_image004.png}}
	* At step 4 of 5, I left the "Enable storage.." box checked, and left it at the default value of 10.0 GiB.
	* I hit "Forward".
	* In the next step, 5 of 5, I left the default chosen name of centos7.0, and hit "Finish".
	* A window popped up sa
