====== star example 1 ======
Created Monday 16 July 2018

[[star -c deep dive]]
[[stat-examples:star-examples]]

**Summary**
In [[star]] example 1, we will compress several files into an archive using the star -c command. Let us review what the -c option does for a given star command:

star-options
* -c
	* creates a new tarfile and writes named files to it
	* writing starts at the beginning of the tarfile
	* verbosity can be increased by adding the -v (verbose) option

Tasks
* Navigate to [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/star/star-compress_ex001]]
* Create 5 new files using the [[touch]] command (we've learned the shortened [[touch]] command using regular expressions, so we'll use that):
	* star_file1
	* star_file2
	* star_file3
	* star_file4
	* star_file5
* Use the [[ls]] command to verify that the files were correctly created.
* Use the [[star]] -c command to create a new tar archive named star_files.tar containing all 5 files 
	* to create a shorter command, we will use a [[regular expressions|regular expression]] instead of typing all of the file names out by hand.
	* Since we want to name the tarfile, we have to add the -f option. The syntax for this is -f=tarfile_name. 
	* For example: star -c -f=tarfile_name.tar files{1..5}
* Use ls to verify that the .tar archive was correctly created.
