[[star-examples]]

When the [[star]] utility is used to compress files or folders into an archive, the [[extended attributes]] are not retained by default.  

The [[extended attributes]] on Linux have four namespaces:
* user
* trusted
* security - The security namespace is used by SELinux.
* system 

Since all of the extended attributes are lost in a star compression by default, the SELinux contexts (part of the security namespace) are lost.  We must have a way to retain them if desired.  To retain the extended attributes during a star compress, we must invoke the -xattr and -H=exustar flags.

To fully understand keeping the extended attibutes, we will compress two sets of files: one without retaining the extended attributes, the other retaining the extended attributes. We will use the [[ls]] command to view the [[SELinux]] contexts in both cases.

First, lets compress a set of files not using -xattr and -H=exustar:

Tasks
* **PART 1**
	* Navigate to [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/star/star-compress_ex002/star-compress_002a]]
	* Create 20 new files: service_request001 to service_request020.
	* Change the [[SELinux]] security context of the 20 files to httpd_sys_content using the [[chcon]] command.
	* View the SELinux security context of the 20 files.
* **PART 2**
	* Use star to compress the 20 files into a tar archive named service_requests_folder.tar.
	* Delete to 20 new files (leave the .tar file intact).
	* Decompress the tar archive.
	* View the SELinux context of the resulting 20 files, and compare them to the context before compression.  Note the changes.

Now, lets compress a set of files USING -xattr and -H=exustar:

Tasks:
* **PART 1**
	* Navigate to [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/star/star-compress_ex002/star-compress_002b]]
	* Create 20 new files: service_request001 to service_request020.
	* Change the [[SELinux]] security context of the 20 files to httpd_sys_content using the [[chcon]] command.
	* View the SELinux security context of the 20 files.

* **PART 2**
	* Use star **WITH -xattr and -H=exustar** to compress the 20 files into a tar archive named service_requests_folder.tar.
	* Delete to 20 new files (leave the .tar file intact).
	* Decompress the tar archive.
	* View the SELinux context of the resulting 20 files, and compare them to the context before compression.  Note the changes.
