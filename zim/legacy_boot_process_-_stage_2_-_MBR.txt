[[BIOS-MBR - legacy boot process]]

**Summary**
After the Power On Self Test ([[POST]]) is complete (see [[legacy boot process - stage 1 - BIOS]]), BIOS searches for a suitable boot devices from a list in the order prescribed by the boot settings stored in [[CMOS]]. This list of bootable devices hard include the hard drives connected to the system, floppy disk drives, optical drives, network interfaces, USB flash drives etc. 

Once the desired bootable devices is found, BIOS looks for the boot sector on the bootable device. This boot sector is known as the [[Master Boot Record]] ([[MBR]]).
