**Summary**
A block is a series of data of fixed length (e.g. 4kB, 8kB etc.). The block size of a filesystem in Linux can be found using the [[blockdev]] command. For examples:
* blockdev --getbsz [[/dev/sda1]] (this command must be run with root privileges => su -c "blockdev --getbsz [[/dev/sda1"]])
