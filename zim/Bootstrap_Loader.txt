**Summary**
The Boostrap Loader's job is to locate the computer's operating system on disk.  If the [[Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:002 - operate running systems:002 - right branches:Boot, reboot, and shut down a system normally:boot:BIOS-MBR - legacy boot process:legacy boot process - stage 1 - BIOS:BIOS]] locates a bootable computer operating system, the Bootstrap Loader will pass control of the computer's startup process to that operating system.  The Bootstap Loader is also known as the [[Boot Loader]].

**BIOS Bootstrap**
The BIOS Bootstrap process consists of four operations:
* [[POST]] - the Power On Self Test.
* Initialization of hardware devices.
* Search for a computer operating system to boot.
* Loading the [[Boot Loader]].
