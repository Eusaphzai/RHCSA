**Summary**
Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77) is a lossless compression algorithm that utilizes variable-rate coding created by [[Abraham Lempel]] and [[Jacob Ziv]] in 1977. They described the compression scheme in their paper [[https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~sam/TI/artigos/ziv78compression.pdf|Compression of Individual Sequences via Variable-Rate Coding]]. Lempel-Ziv-coding is employed to the Linux utility [[Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:001 - left branches:Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2:gzip]].
