**Summary**
[[CentOS]] stands for [[Community Enterprise Operating System]]. [[CentOS]] is built from the open source software packages that are used to build [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] ([[RHEL]]). A specified version of [[CentOS]] is virtually 100% compatible with the same version number of RHEL. For example, someone wanting to learn RHEL 7.3 could download and install [[CentOS]] 7.3, and the experience would almost be completely identical to the RHEL experience.  Using RHEL requires the computer user to pay a support fee to Red Hat, while [[CentOS]] can be downloaded and installed for free. This makes [[CentOS]] very attractive to people who want to learn RHEL.
