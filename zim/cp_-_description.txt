**Summary**
The cp command is used to copy a file or directory from a //SOURCE// location to a //DESTINATION// location. The general systax of the command is as follows:
cp //SOURCE// //DESTINATION//

For example, let us assume that we want to copy a file named test_text_file.odt from FOLDER1 to FOLDER2 in the current working directory. We would simply issue this command:
mv FOLDER1/test_text_file.odt FOLDER2
