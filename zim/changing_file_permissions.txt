changing file permissions with Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:chmod
* File permissions are also known as access modes.  
* Changing the permission of a file is done using the Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:chmod command.
* Tis is the general syntax for chmod:
	* //chmod ?-permissions filename//
* In the sample chmod command above, the ? is replaced with one of the letters below:
	* u: the user that owns the file.
	* g: the group associated with the file.
	* o:  all system users not covered by u or g above.
	* a: all of the above.  a is the equivalent of ugo.
