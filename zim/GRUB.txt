[[Boot Loader]]

**Summary**
GRUB stands for [[GRand Unified Bootloader]]. GRUB is what is known as a [[Multiboot]] boot loader. The [[Boot Loader]] is the first program that runs on a computer system after the Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:002 - operate running systems:002 - right branches:Boot, reboot, and shut down a system normally:boot:BIOS-MBR - legacy boot process:legacy boot process - stage 1 - BIOS:BIOS Power On Self Test ([[POST]]) passes.  GRUB is the most popular Boot Loader on Linux computer systems. On a Linux system where GRUB acts as the Boot Loader, GRUB handles loading and transferring control to the Linux kernel. Once the kernel receives control, it initializes the rest of the computer operating system (user space).
