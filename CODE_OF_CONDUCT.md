# Zim-powered RHCSA Study Guide Community Code of Conduct

## 1. Preamble

In the Zim-powered RHCSA Study Guide community, participants from all over the world come together to create a Free Software Study Guide for the community of Red Hat-loving IT professionals. This is made possible by the support, hard work and enthusiasm of thousands of people, including those who contribute to and use the Zim-powered RHCSA Study Guide.

This document offers some guidance to ensure that Zim-powered RHCSA Study Guide participants can cooperate effectively in a positive and inspiring atmosphere, and to explain how together we can strengthen and support each other.

This Code of Conduct is shared by all contributors and users who engage with the Zim-powered RHCSA Study Guide team and its community services.

## 2. Overview

This Code of Conduct presents a summary of the shared values and “common sense” thinking in our community. The basic social ingredients that hold our project together include:
    • Be considerate 
    • Be respectful 
    • Be collaborative 
    • Be pragmatic 
    • Support others in the community 
    • Get support from others in the community 

Our community is made up of several groups of individuals and organizations which can roughly be divided into two groups:
    • Contributors, or those who add value to the project through improving Zim-powered RHCSA Study Guide software and its services 
    • Users, or those who add value to the project through their support as consumers of Zim-powered RHCSA Study Guide software 

This Code of Conduct reflects the agreed standards of behavior for members of the Zim-powered RHCSA Study Guide community, in any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, IRC channel, public meeting or private correspondence within the context of the Zim-powered RHCSA Study Guide team and its services. The community acts according to the standards written down in this Code of Conduct and will defend these standards for the benefit of the community. Leaders of any group, such as moderators of mailing lists, IRC channels, forums, etc., will exercise the right to suspend access to any person who persistently breaks our shared Code of Conduct.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. rex@idac.io.



Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## 7. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify Rex Djere with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.



## 8. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
