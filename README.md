To build this study guide, I am using the following <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software" target="_blank">free software</a>:
- Freemind (for mind maps): http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
- Zim Desktop Wiki: http://zim-wiki.org/
- Anki (for flashcards): https://apps.ankiweb.net/
	- The Anki flashcard deck is shared here: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/649267865
	- See here for important information about how I share the flashcard deck on Anki:
- git/git-gui (version control): https://git-scm.com/

To get the most out of this study guide, you should do the following:
- Have a standalone computer with the latest version of CentOS installed to do the exercises (https://www.centos.org/)
- Install Freemind, Zim, Anki, and git-gui (I started writing this guide on a Fedora 28 computer). 
	- For me I'd install them with this command: su -c "dnf install freemind zim anki git-gui"
	- On CentOS, you might use this command: su -c "yum install freemind zim anki git-gui"
- (optional) Sign up for a free AnkiWeb account (https://ankiweb.net/)
- Clone https://github.com/RexDjere/RHCSA to this directory on your Linux pc: /home/your_username/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA
- After cloning the git repository, RHCSA should have the following files/folders inside:
	- anki (holds exported text file containing all flashcard Q&As)
	- examples (holds all study guide examples)
	- LICENSE.md (contains GPL v3 license text)
	- mindmaps (hold all mindmaps created with Freemind)
	- README.md (the study guide's home page)
	- zim (holds all zim wiki pages)
	- .git (shows if you have system set to show hidden files)
- When you run Zim, you'll want to open the zim folder as a notebook. Once you do, you'll be able to navigate/edit all of the wiki pages.
- Freemind will allow you to open and edit the mindmaps, and Anki will allow you to view/edit the flashcards.
- git/git-gui will allow you to checkout the study guide, edit parts of it if you wish, and create pull requests to update the master branch.
- I'll periodically export the latest version of the Anki flashcards to the anki directory.

Enjoy the definitive RHCSA Study Guide!
