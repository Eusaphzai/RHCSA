# Anki Shared Deck
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Anki has a very nice feature: it allows you to share your flash card decks with others for download. Unfortunately, the downloadable version does not automatically update as you add more cards to the deck, or edit existing cards.  So this is what I'll do:
- I'll periodically re-share the Anki RHCSA Study Guide deck as I update it. 
- This requires me to unshare the exising version of the deck, and to then re-share it.  
- Each time that you re-share a deck, the numerical string at the end of its web address changes (e.g. https://ankiweb.net/decks/share/12345678910)
- So each time that I re-share the deck, I'll update the RHSCA Study Guide GitHub [README.md page.](../README.md)
Each time that I share the deck, I'll keep all of the parameters exactly the same to make the deck as easy as possible to find:
	- Title:
		- Anki Flashcard Deck - Study Guide - RHCSA
	- Tags:
		- rhcsa linux
	- Descsription:
		- This Anki flash card deck complements the RHCSA Study Guide that I created [here.](../../../../RHCSA) Enjoy!
