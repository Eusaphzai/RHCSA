Cliff believes that bad actors could hack into his work computer to see sensitive files, so he decides to encrypt the files in his sensitive_files directory. The sensitive_files directory contains 20 files: sensitive_file001 through sensitive_file020.<div><br /></div><div>He wants to individually encrypt the files using the gpg command without first rolling them into an archive. &nbsp;He tries this command: gpg -c sensitive_files{001..020}</div><div><br /></div><div>Will it work? Why or why not?</div>	It will not work. The gpg -c command can only accept one file as an argument per encryption session. So he would either have run the gpg -c command 20 times (gpg -c sensitive_file001, gpg -c sensitive_file002, so on and so forth) OR he could roll the 20 files into a single archive, and then encrypt that entire archive.
